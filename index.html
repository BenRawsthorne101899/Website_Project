            Welcome to my website! Here you will find out a bit about me. Mainly what my favourite games are and the music I love listening to! I will include a bit about what each game is and why I enjoy them as well as what music genres I listen to with a few of my favourite artists.

            Playing video games is one of my biggest hobbies outside of working or hanging out with my friends. I play on many consoles such as PC, XBOX, Nintendo Switch and will play a variety of genres such as FPS, RPGs, Racing, Adventure and more!

            I am a huge fan of EDM and the sub-genres that are intertwined in EDM. This can include genres such as dubstep, DnB, Future House, Bass House and Electro.
