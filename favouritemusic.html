            The first artist is Bossfight. He is a Swedish artist that mainly releases music in DnB and Dubstep with a few of the subgenres of those. His music is very upbeat and constantly makes me bob my head up and down, some songs are more intense than others but it is why I like listening to him as he has a very varied style and can do most types of music! Some of my favourite songs from him include: No Sleep, Beatdown, Subside.

            The second artist is Koven. They are a UK based duo that mainly releases music in DnB and Drumstep and sometimes Future House. Their music is very uplifting and will make you want to dance, they also have some calmer songs that are very somber compared to the heavier dubstep and drumstep that they normally release. Some of my favorite songs from them include: Shut my Mouth, Let Go and Breathing Me In.

            The third artist is Grant. He is an American artist who mainly releases music in Future Bass, Electronic and Chillout. His music is very relaxing and is sure to put you in a good mood! He has also done a few acoustic versions of some of his songs which are extremely calming to listen to especially if you prefer acoustic music more. Some of my songs that he has released include: Are We Still Young, Fault and Color.
