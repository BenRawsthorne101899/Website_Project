            Welcome to the gaming page, here I will describe some of the games I like to play and explain a bit about them and why I like them.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I had to pick 4 games to choose as my favourite 4 then they would probably be these (in no particular order):
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list">
        <ul class="List">
            <li> Smite </li>
            <li> Dark Souls 3 </li>
            <li> Rainbow 6 Siege </li>
            <li> Hollow Knight </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="Smite">
        <p>
            Smite is a free to play MOBA based around 100+ gods and goddesses from many mythologies of different countries, it is designed to be online only as it is multiplayer however there are some single player options in case someone just wants to go against preset bots. It includes many microtransactions which is how the game is allowed to be freee to play, these transactions include new skins for the gods, loading screens, voice packs, global emotes etc. I enjoy playing this because I love reading about the different gods and goddesses and overall while it has the frustrations that come with online games, it is a very fun game to play whether for a couple of games or as a game to play for hours on end.

    <div class="DS3">
        <p>
            Dark Souls 3 is an RPG that heavily relies on your patience as a player, it is a very difficult game to start with but as you learn the fight patterns of enemies you start to get better making it slightly easier. The weapons and armour system is highly customisable meaning you are able to dress your character however you want and make a build around many different weapons however you need to consider what type of build you want to do. 
        <br>
            A strength build allows you to carry and use heavy greatswords and hammers, they are slow but hit very hard. Dexterity allows you to wield shortswords, katanas and bows, they sacrifice damage for more maneuverability and speed. Pyromancy allows you to cast spells that are fire based and once you get to late game you can unlock dark fire spells. Finally there is sorcery/faith, these builds allow you to cast a variety of crystal spells and miracles, some can heal you for a more support based character or you could go full damage! It is an amazing game with lots of hidden lore in the item descriptions and NPC dialogue. It's frustrating but addicting at the same time!

    <div class="R6Siege">
        <p>
            Rainbow 6 Siege is a First Person Shooter based in modern/future setting. It is mainly multiplayer with the option for training against bots or custom games. There are a variety of characters with different gadgets and tools to use to beat your enemies. It is a round based game where you have 1 of 3 objectives: defuse the bomb, secure the objective or rescue the hostage. It is a very tactical first person shooter where you have to plan out how you enter the building and make sure that you take out any enemy gadgets trying to stop you. I really enjoy playing R6 because it can be either a very fast paced game or very methodical depending on how you and your team decide to execute it.

    <div class="HollowKnight">
        <p>
            Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania/RPG that is heavily story driven while also not having much narrative behind it. It relies on you putting the pieces together and figuring out where to go and what items to use along the way by having you read the descriptions of the items and finding out what it is trying to tell you. Similar to Dark Souls it is a very difficult game to play, with bosses having very erratic behaviour during fights and hitting your health very hard at the same time. Again like Dark Souls it is a massively rewarding game to play once you defeat a boss. I really like this game as it makes you try to piece some of the story together yourself and not just giving it all to you via dialogue and also I love the difficulty aspect it as it is almost addicting because if I die I will want to play again and try and get back to where I was.
